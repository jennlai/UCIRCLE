Laser Talk: Expressing Gender,"The Beall Center for Art + Technology is proud to present the second event in a four-part series: ""LASER Talk: Expressing Gender."" This panel talk and discussion will take place on Monday  March 20  5:30-7:30pm at The Cove in UCI Applied Innovation  and feature several guest speakers on the subject of gender expression  embodiment  and development. Held in conjunction with the Beall Center's current exhibition  ""Masculine  Feminine"" (on view through May 13  2017)  ""LASER Talk: Expressing Gender"" is part of the Leonardo Journal and Society for the Arts  Sciences and Technology's international network of free public engagement events called LASERs (Leonardo Art Science Evening Rendezvous) - an events series that was started by cultural historian Piero Scaruffi in January 2008 as a local forum for presenting art and science projects.  . . Has the expanded notion of a gender spectrum affected the way we see ourselves? Through the advent of new social  psychological  and technological resources  we have unprecedented ways to discover our identity. Moderated by David Familian (Artistic Director  Beall Center for Art + Technology) and Micol Hebron (Independent Curator  Performance Artist  and Professor at Chapman University)  this conversation will unpack the various avenues through which gender can be expressed and defined – including those in art  psychology  evolutionary biology  and the humanities.. The LASER Talk will feature a special presentation by contemporary artist  Cassils.  . . Cassils has achieved international recognition for a rigorous engagement with the body as a form of social sculpture. Featuring a series of bodies transformed by strict physical training regimes  Cassils’ artworks offer shared experiences for contemplating histories of violence  representation  struggle  and survival  often juxtaposing the immediacy  urgency and ephemerality of live performance against constructed acts for camera in order to challenge the “documentarian truth factor” of images. Bashing through gendered binaries  Cassils performs transgender not as a crossing from one sex to another  but rather as a continual process of becoming ─ a form of embodiment that works in a space of indeterminacy  spasm and slipperiness. Drawing on conceptualism  feminism  body art  gay male aesthetics  Cassils forges a series of powerfully trained bodies for different performative purposes. It is with sweat  blood and sinew that Cassils constructs a visual critique around ideologies and histories.Cassils was born in Montreal (Canada) and lives and works in Los Angeles (CA). Their work appears in the Beall Center's ""Masculine  Feminine"" exhibition courtesy of the artist and Ronald Feldman Fine Arts  New York (NY).. . Other speakers will include experts from UCI's departments of Gender & Sexuality Studies  Psychology and Social Behavior  and Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. A full speaker list will be posted prior to the event.. . .

Cyber Attacks and Defenses: Trends  Challenges  and Outlook,"A cyber attacker needs to find only one way in  while defenders need to guard a lot of ground. Adversaries can fully debug and perfect their attacks on their own computers  exactly replicating the environment that they will later be targeting. This is the situation today  which has been exacerbated by an increasing trend towards a software ""monoculture"" (in which there are only two major desktop operating systems and two major phone operating systems  one major office software suite  and so on). . . One possible defense is software diversity  which raises the bar to attackers. A lot of academic and industrial research is currently investigating such software diversity  from simple ASLR (address space layout randomization) to more complex whole-program randomization. In the latter  a diversification engine automatically generates a large number of different versions of the same program  potentially one unique version for every computer. These all behave in exactly the same way from the perspective of the end-user  but they implement their functionality in subtly different ways. As a result  a specific attack will succeed on only a small fraction of targets and a large number of different attack vectors would be needed to take over a significant percentage of them. Because an attacker has no way of knowing a priori which specific attack will succeed on which specific target  this method also very significantly increases the cost of attacks directed at specific targets. . . . Unfortunately  attackers have now started assembling their attacks on the target itself  circumventing diversity. Hence  in the arms race between attackers and defenders  we are already at the point where yet another set of defenses is needed  before the previous one is even fully deployed across the software industry.  . . . My talk will present a time-line of attacks and defenses  clearly illustrating a ""cat and mouse game"" in which defenses are almost always reactive to attacks that have already happened.  I will discuss his vision of how to get ahead of the attackers  and close by stating why  in spite of the bleak situation today  I am confident that we will eventually be able to stop most kinds of cyber attacks completely. . .
